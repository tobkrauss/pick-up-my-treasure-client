# Pick-Up-My-Treasure

Over the years that I have lived in Berlin, I have seen time and again, especially in Friedrichshain, that people often just put their furniture, electronics or other things outside the front door when they want to get rid of them.
Generally, this is probably often a good idea in terms of sustainability, but in reality it usually just causes rubbish and an ugly cityscape. One reason for lots of that "trash" on the sidewalks is probably that too few people know what is there and could get picked up for free.

With this in mind, I have programmed "pick up my treasure", a React app on which interested people can discover what people have placed on the sidewalk in front of the front door.
On a map, you can see where which item, called "treasure", is or even find out the exact address via a detail page.
At the same time, users can also post their own items that may have been left outside their front door and delete them again when they have been collected.
